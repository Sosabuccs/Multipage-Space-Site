    <p class="intro">The solar system can be rephrased as the celestial system consisting of the sun and all the objects that orbit it, including planets, moons, asteroids, and comets.
    The solar system refers to the collection of celestial bodies, such as the sun, planets, and other objects, that are bound together by gravity and orbit around the sun.The solar system consists of the sun and everything that orbits around it, including planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and other small objects. At the center of the solar system is the sun, an average-sized yellow star that provides light and heat to the planets. The four inner planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These rocky planets are closest to the sun and are called the terrestrial planets.Our solar system orbits the center of the Milky Way galaxy at about 515,000 mph (828,000 kph). We're in one of the galaxy's four spiral arms. It takes our solar system about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the galactic center. There are three general kinds of galaxies: elliptical, spiral, and irregular.</p>

    <p>At the heart of the solar system lies the sun, a dazzling sphere of seething plasma and intense energy. It dominates the system, providing light, heat, and energy to all its planetary companions. But did you know that the sun is so massive that it contains over 99% of the total mass of the solar system? Itâ€™s a cosmic heavyweight, exerting its gravitational influence over everything within its reach.</p>

    <p>The solar system is a vast and wondrous place, filled with mysteries waiting to be uncovered. From the blazing brilliance of the sun to the icy depths of the outer reaches, each celestial body offers a glimpse into the cosmic dance of creation and destruction. As we continue to explore and discover, we gain a deeper appreciation for the beauty and complexity of our cosmic neighborhood, reminding us of the infinite wonders that await us in the cosmos.</p>

   <p>The solar system boasts an impressive lineup of planets, each with its unique characteristics and quirks. From the scorching inferno of Mercury to the icy expanse of Neptune, these worlds offer a glimpse into the diverse tapestry of our cosmic neighborhood. Interestingly, the largest planet in the solar system, Jupiter, is so massive that it could fit over 1,300 Earths inside it!</p>
